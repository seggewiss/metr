**Metr** is a simple and lightweight metronome application designed for musicians who need a reliable, offline tool for keeping time during practice sessions. Tired of dealing with internet connectivity issues or carrying around your phone? Metr is here to help! It runs natively on Windows and MacOs and doesn't require an internet connection to function.

## Features
